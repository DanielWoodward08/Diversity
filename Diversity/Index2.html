Find a Mentor: Think of a mentor like your personal guide through the jungle of IT. They've been there, done that, and can offer killer advice on everything from career paths to handling workplace challenges. Don't be shy to reach out and connect with someone who's been in your shoes!

Build Your Squad: Surround yourself with a tribe of kick-ass women and allies in the industry. Whether it's joining professional groups, hitting up industry events, or just grabbing coffee with fellow techies, having a crew who's got your back can make all the difference.

Hone Your Tech Skills: Time to sharpen those coding swords! Building up your technical skills, whether it's mastering coding languages, diving into software development, or beefing up your cybersecurity chops, is key to slaying it in the IT realm.                      </p>
